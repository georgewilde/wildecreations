# Live setup

# Development setup
This is a single page static site. All content changes should be made to index.html.

Scripting is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Icons are generated by [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).

The setup and site design is inspired by [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), 
Themeforest's [Canvas template](https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123) and 
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).
