        <h1>Top 7 podcasts of 2016 for business minded programmers</h1>
        <p>As the year draws to a close I thought I would share the top programming, technology and business podcasts I’ve discovered and enjoyed in 2016.</p>
        <p>While some of these podcasts cover languages I have a personal interest in, there is some great content for anyone interested in good programming practices or the business of running a tech
            company.</p>
        <p>So grab yourself a mince pie, a glass of sherry and enjoy some interesting listening this Christmas and throughout 2017.</p>

                    friendly, down to earth approach gets valuable business information from the founders of companies like Zapier, Trustpilot, Hired.com and Basecamp. Covering how they got started,

                    to anyone dealing with front-end development. Each week the panelists discuss a different topic with a guest with experience in that area. Often the guest is from a company
                    involved in the topic and I’ve discovered many great resources from this high production podcast.

        <p><em>The podcast for professional software developers.</em>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-9">
                <div class="text-justify">Following a similar format to Software Engineering Daily (though this podcast has been around longer), Software Engineering Radio provides an in-depth review
                    of a broad range of subjects relating to professional software development. Featuring all original content and interviews from industry leaders, this educational podcast is a great
                    way to continuously develop your own knowledge and understanding of software development and best practices.

        <p><em>A podcast for developers designed to fit inside your tea break.</em>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-9">
                <div class="text-justify">I’ve only recently started listening to this show but I’m enjoying the format. At only 10 - 20 mins long it’s ideal to listen to while……errrrr…..having a cup
                    of tea (or cycling to work). The subject is broad and language agnostic. I’d say the depth each subject gets into is probably aimed at more junior to middleweight developers,
                    though it’s always good to be reminded of the basics of anything in life, even if you have a lot of experience.

            Radio Hour</a></h3>
        <p><em>A journey through fascinating ideas, astonishing inventions, and new ways to think and create. Based on riveting TEDTalks from the world’s most remarkable minds.</em>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-9">
                <div class="text-justify">OK so this isn’t strictly programming or business related but I had to include it as it’s such an informative and entertaining listen. Each episode takes a
                    different subject matter and brings together snippets of TED talks and interviews with the people giving those talks to help educate and intrigue on subjects like, “Infinity”, “The
                    food we eat”, “The meaning of work” and “How we love”. It’s hugely popular and very well produced, a good listen for when your brain is a bit full of all the usual coding stuff and
                    you just fancy a change.

        <p>I listen to a lot of podcasts during my cycle commute and during my down-time in the evenings and weekends. I hope you find something interesting in this list, if so, please do share the
            list and good word.</p>
